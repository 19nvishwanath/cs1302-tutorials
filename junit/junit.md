# JUnit Tutorial

![Status: Not Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Not%20Ready-red.svg)

## Introduction

[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is programmer-friendly _unit testing framework_ for Java.
A **unit test** is some code that attempts to test another unit of code. In Java, the word 
unit generally means method. The JUnit framework provides the following:

* A set of static methods and annotations that make writing unit tests easier. Instead of
  rewriting conditionals for passing or failing a test, implementing a counter for passed
  versus failed test cases, and setting up complicated control flow scenarios to test for
  exceptions, the JUnit framework already provides these things.
  
* A driver program to discover and run the unit tests. 

## Getting Started

1. Login to your Nike account.

1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves 
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory 
   called `cs1302-jdb`:

   ```
   $ curl -s -L UPDATE-THIS-LINK | bash
   ```
   
1. Change into the `cs1302-junit` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
