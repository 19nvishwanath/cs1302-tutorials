## Getting Started

1. Login to your Nike account.

1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves 
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory 
   called `cs1302-jdb`:

   ```
   $ curl -s -L UPDATE-THIS-LINK | bash
   ```
   
1. Change into the `cs1302-junit` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
