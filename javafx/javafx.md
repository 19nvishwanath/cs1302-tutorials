# JavaFX Tutorial

JavaFX is a library for creating and delivering applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
in Java. In this couse, we will use JavaFX 8 as it comes with Java 8. The API documentation for
the many packages included ith JavaFX can be found 
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm).

## Getting Started

1. First, you need to ensure that your terminal emulator supports X-forwarding. This allows
   the GUI parts of your application to be forwarded to your local computer in addition to
   the terminal output. To check this, work through the rest of this section of the
   tutorial. First, login to Nike using the `ssh` command along with the `-XY` option. 
   As always, be sure to replace `username` with your Nike username.
   
   ```
   $ ssh -XY username@nike.cs.uga.edu
   ```
   
1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves 
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory 
   called `cs1302-javafx`:

   ```
   $ curl -s -L https://git.io/fhAR8 | bash
   ```
