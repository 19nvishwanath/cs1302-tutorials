## Introduction

## Generic Interfaces

Consider the [`java.lang.Comparable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html)
interface. This is formally known as `Comparable<T>`, even though its FQN is `java.lang.Comparable`.
The interface documentation goes into a lot of detail (as it should), but this interface is responsible
for defining the semantics of the [`compareTo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo-T-)
method.
