# Generic Methods Tutorial

![Status: Not Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Not%20Ready-red.svg)

This tutorial introduces the reader to generic methods in Java.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the reader has a knowledge of basic Unix commands and experience working
with a command-line text editor (e.g. emacs, vi, etc.). The reader should be familiar with compiling
and running Java code contained in packages.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should follow along and take notes.

### Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO2.d:** (Partial) Implement new generic methods, interfaces, and classes in a software solution.

## Video Example

In this video example, we identify some segments of code that are nearly
identical except for the fact that they operate on different datatypes, then 
we refactor the code into a datatype-independent method using generics.

## Required Additional Reading

Now that you're familiar with some of the basic concepts relate to generic
methods in Java, you need to read the official Oracle reading:

* [The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials: Generic Methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/methods.html)

If you have any questions related to the Generic Methods reading provided by
Oracle, then feel free to ask them on the course Piazza.
