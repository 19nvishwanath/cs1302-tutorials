# Setting up your own GitHub Account

In this tutorial, we will walk you through creating your own GitHub account, creating a private repository 
(so your code won't be publicly visible on the web), and cloning and pushing content to your private, 
online repository.

**Note**: You should never create a public repository for work that you are doing for a class.

## Setting up an Account

As students, you receive **free access** to [GitHub Pro](https://github.com/pricing) while you a student.
To set up your account:

1. [Click Here](https://education.github.com/pack/join)
1. Click on "Yes, I'm a Student"
1. Fill out the form and submit for review
1. Wait on email confirmation from GitHub. Hopefully, this will take less than a day.

## Creating a Repository

1. Login to [GitHub](www.github.com)
1. Click on "New" under the repositories section on the left-hand side of the page.
1. You should see a screen similar to the image below. Type `cs1302-my-first-repo`
   as the name of your repository, click `private`
