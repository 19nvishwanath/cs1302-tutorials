## Introduction

According to
[Chapter 4 of the _Java Language Specification_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.10.1),

> There are two kinds of types in the Java programming language: 
> primitive types ([ยง4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2)) and 
> reference types ([ยง4.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3)). 
> There are, correspondingly, two kinds of data values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, 
> returned by methods, and operated on: 
> primitive values ([ยง4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2)) and 
> reference values ([ยง4.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3)).
