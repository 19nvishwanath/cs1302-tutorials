## Table of Contents

## Control and Meta

Throughout this tutorial we will use `C` to refer to the control key (`CTRL`)
and `M` to refer to the meta key. On most systems, `ALT` or `ESC`
correspond to `M`. On macOS, the Terminal application can be configured
to use `OPT` as `M`.

| Key | Name    | Usually             |
|-----|---------|---------------------|
| `C` | Control | `CTRL`              |
| `M` | Meta    | `ESC`, `ALT`, `OPT` |

## Open / Create File

To open a file caled `src/cs1302/Test.java` in Emacs, you can execute the
following command:

```
$ emacs src/cs1302/Test.java
```

Alternatively, you can simply execute `emacs`, then use `C-x C-f` to find the
file you're trying to open.

To create a file, use one of the methods just desribed with your desired
filename. When you create a new file, Emacs will display `(New file)` at 
the bottom of the screen. The new file does not actually exist until you
save it, usually using `C-x C-s`.
