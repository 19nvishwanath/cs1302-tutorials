# Interfaces

TODO write intro

**Colophon:** Many of the code examples in this tutorial are adapted from
[[1]](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Lewis-Java-Foundations-Introduction-to-Program-Design-and-Data-Structures-4th-Edition/PGM76634.html)
under academic fair use.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the reader has a knowledge of basic Unix commands and experience working 
with a command-line text editor (e.g. emacs, vi, etc.). To get the most out of this tutorial, 
you should follow along and take notes.

### Getting Started

The steps in this tutorial assume that you are logged into the Nike server. 

1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves 
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory 
   called `cs1302-interfaces`:

   ```
   $ curl -s -L REPLACE_URL_HERE | bash
   ```
  
1. Change into the `cs1302-interfaces` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the current directory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find .
   ```
   
   Inspect each `.java` file that was listed. You will notice that some of them contain interfaces
   instead of classes. They can be identified by looking for the `interface` keyword instead of
   the `class` keyword in the overall type declaration specified near the top of the file. We say
   "type" declaration because a `.java` file can be used to declare any kind of reference type in
   Java.
