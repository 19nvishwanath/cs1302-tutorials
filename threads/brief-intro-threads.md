## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the reader has a knowledge of basic Unix commands and experience working with a command-line text editor (e.g. emacs, vi, etc.). To get the most out of this tutorial, you should follow along and take notes.

## Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO1.a:** Navigate and modify files, directories, and permissions in a multi-user Unix-like environment.
* **LO1.c:** Create and modify textfiles and source code using a powerful terminal-based text editor such as Emacs or Vi.
* **LO1.d:** Use shell commands to compile new and existing software solutions that are organized into multi-level packages
  and have external dependencies.

## Video

In this video, we introduce the concept of a thread and provide some code examples to illustrate how threads 
can be used to make your program execute two pieces of code at the same time. Many of the definitions presented 
in this video are simplified in order to make them more approachable for beginners.
