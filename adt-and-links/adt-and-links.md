# ADTs and Lists Tutorial

## Introduction

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level (abstract) description of a data type which includes the operations (methods)
available on the data type. The exact implementation details, including the underlying structure, are left to the programmer. 
There are often many useful implementations for a given ADT. The decision of which implementation depends on which one would
be more efficient for the application at hand.

## The List ADT

A common ADT is the List ADT. You can think of a List as a collection of objects (not only strings). When working with a list,
the programmer would want to perform certain operations, including, but not limited to:

   * Creating a new list.
   * Searching for an object in the list.
   * Adding an object to the list.
   * Removing an object from the list.
   * Clearing the list.

Notice that the description and operations given above were independent of any underlying data structure or implementation.
When thinking of an ADT, try to avoid worrying about those details.

## Implementations of the List ADT

A common approach is to either implement the List ADT using an array or a linked list. Since you're familiar with
arrays, we will start with a discussion of this approach.
